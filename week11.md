# Week 11
## Meeting
This weekâ€™s meeting was again mainly used to demonstrate what we have development wise. Since we fixed up a lot of the bugs that we had in the previous week, we were able to demonstrate a proper working version of our code, we also had two methods of selecting item, pointing using the left finger and selecting using the head. We were able to test out both methods to see which one is better. We also discussed the poster which we will be presenting the following week. 

## Before the next meeting
This week we mainly worked on finishing off our project and researching heuristic evaluation so that we could conduct one of our own for our VR environment. We had to decide what categories we were going to evaluate. We choose categories that were important aspect of VR such as impressiveness, glitches (response time) and other important aspects. We also spent a lot of the week working on the poster, as we wanted to send a copy to our supervisor to get some feedback.
