# Week 2
## Meeting
This week in our meeting we got an introduction to our research topic which is Natural Interaction Methods in Augmented Reality. We discussed some of the approaches we will take in order to conduct our research in a professional manner. We also discussed the import aspects of the project including a general direction and types of outcomes we expect from the project.  
We decided that we would work in VR first and then move to AR later after we have our project working well in VR as it is easier to work in VR. We also looked at and tried on the type of VR and AR headsets we would be working with for our project. It was decided that we would work on the HTC Vive for VR. It was also decided that we developing in Unity so we would need to set that up and get familiar with it. 

## Before next meeting
I have downloaded Unity and set it up. I have leant how to use it by making a ball rolling game using a tutorial, this included writing C# code which was new to me.
