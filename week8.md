# Week 8
## Meeting
In this weekâ€™s meeting we discussed a specific functionality that we want to implement in our project which was querying data for a specific object in our VR environment. We discussed how we would present the specified data as there were different option such as displaying it the world space or putting it a fixed position in front of the camera (screen display). This would mainly consist of displaying graphs for the selected objects. 
We also went into the room which has the HTC Vive set up and got a demonstration of how to set it up and use the computers in that room which were better suited to handle heavy applications such as Unity especially with VR headsets which require a lot of computation. 

## Before next meeting
This week we focused on a lot on developing a early version of our deliverable. 
We started to look into and use a graph maker which is a Unity asset our supervisors were able to purchase for us. We were able to display a simple graph in our VR world which had no real stream of useful data, but we used it has a building block for future development. 
So far up to the end of this week we were able to have our model of the building with leap hands that are interactive with a few random object in the environment but do not yet provide any useful functionality. We also have graphs in our environment that are hard coded with no stream of data.
