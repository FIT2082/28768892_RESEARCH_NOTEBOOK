# Week 12
This week we did not have a meeting with our supervisors, but we were still able to meet with the other group to test out each other’s developments and give feed back which is a part of the heuristic evaluation. We were able to find out a lot about or work by allowing someone who didn’t work on it to test it. We were able to realise which gestures and routines were not intuitive to a regular user. We also found out that one of our selection methods worked better than the other which a big difference in error occurrence between them. Point with finger proved to be more intuitive but more error prone as the leap motion was not always able to detect the exact direction that the index finger was pointing. The alternative method which was pointing using a head was less intuitive but also more accurate as getting the direction of the head was very simple and accurate, but with this method, the user is not able to stop and choose when they want to select items and when they don’t. The head is continuously selecting anything that is in the head’s direction that is selectable. We also presented our elevated speeches alongside our poster this week and a large part of the week was put into preparing this.
