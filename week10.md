# Week 10
## Meeting
This week I was not able to attend the meeting, but my partner was able to demonstrate the Unity environment we have developed so far. There were glitches with some of our implementation when it came to removing graphs. The using of pointing hands for selection was also not the best way of selecting as the leap motion was not accurate in mapping the userâ€™s hands and finger direction to the virtual hands.

## Before next meeting
Over the course of the week, we fixed a lot of the bugs with respect to showing and removing graphs. Now when we select an object and display a graph for it, we can select another item and show its graph as well but when we want to remove the graph we can select the object we want to remove graph for and perform the according gesture to remove it while the object selected is still very clear to the user as it is glowing. 
We also added a new functionality to our environment. This new functionality allows the user to open up their left hand and face it towards them to have a menu pop up coming out of their fingers to select the x an y axis they wish to display for the graphs. This functionality is not fully implemented yet and still has a lot of work that needs to be done but so are we have the menu showing up on the hand when the hand is opened up, but nothing happens when the menu items are pressed yet.
