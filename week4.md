# Week 4
## Meeting
This week in our meeting we mainly focused reviewing the project specification, making sure that our understanding of the project was aligned with our supervisorâ€™s visions for the project. There were also details of the projects that we need to decide on which we discussed and agreed on. We also discussed some of the methods of interaction for VR and AR we found from our research. 
Our research specification gave us a more clear idea on the exact objective of our research project as it is a large area of study and there are many aspects we could focus on and a variety of approaches for each aspect. 

## Before next meeting
This week we finished of the project specification and focused on conducting more research on past implementations of interaction in VR and AR. We are able to find a lot of past paper on methods that other researchers have created or used to achieve similar objectives on other projects. These methods including hand gestures, eye gazing and speech. We also continued working on unity and learning more on how to use it. The other group working with us were also able to import the model that we will be using for our project into unity so they were able to help us import the same model after they cleaned up and suitable for VR use in unity.
