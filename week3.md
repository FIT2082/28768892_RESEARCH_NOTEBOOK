# Week 3 
## Meeting
This week we joined another group who were also doing a similar project, Navigation in VR. Joining this group was beneficial for both groups as the start of both project included learning the same things; Unity and VR. We will also be using some of some same data so it will help to help each other in working with this data. The week we discussed the details of the project so that we are equipped to write an accurate project specification. We also discussed the structure of project specifications.

## Before next meeting 
We worked on our project specification and took a lot of researching and discussing the direction of our research project. We investigated a lot of different paper to see what work had been done in the area of natural interaction methods within VR and AR. We discussed the combination of some of these methods, carefully deciding which methods we aligned with our objectives for the project.
