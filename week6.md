# Week 6
## Meeting 
This week we discussed more literature that were relevant to our research and could assist us in coming up with ideas of a general idea of some of the functionality and thing we want to implement or look more into. 
We looked at a way of brainstorming which included writing down idea and selecting 3 and drawing a design for these three ideas then finally choosing to implement two and then doing an evolution on these two implementations. 
We also shared the things we were able to implement with the leap motion over the past week. Since our project required a 3D model of an area of Monash, we were able to get this model from the group we had joined. They had imported the model to Unity and cleaned up some of its data. 
As the objective of our VR application was to display data about an object, we got a chance to look at exactly what types of data that we had to work with which give us a more clear idea of exactly what we could implement using this data. 

# Before the meeting
This week, using the 3D model that was imported to unity as the base, we were able to add simple movement application to this Unity scene. 
The simple movement included walking around and using the mouse to look around the environment. Completing this also assisted us in expanding our knowledge of Unity which would set a good foundation for the following weeks. 
We also got together again and discussed the use of some of the technologies that we have such as the HTC Vive controllers and how it could be used or not used in combination with other technology such as the leap motion.
