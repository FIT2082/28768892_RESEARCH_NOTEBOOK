# Week 5
## Meeting
This week we looked into the leap motion which is a device created to detect hand gestures. We installed the needed software to run in on our own machines and looked at the assets packages need for Unity in order to use the device and software with Unity. We decided this would be our main means for natural interaction within out VR and AR environment.  We also continued talking about papers and other project such as the ImAxes and Charticulator which included features we could possibility assess and maybe include in our project. The main focus of the meeting was discussing how we were going to display information and what methods we could incorporate to make our data interactive such as having graph that had axes that could be changed by the user through the use of natural interaction methods. Our supervisor recommended tools to look into to help us work with unity such as VRTK which is a package for Unity that has implementation for a lot of the things that could be used in a Unity software.

## Before next meeting
After finishing the set up of the leap motion, I made a Unity game where I used the leap motion to control a ball. I researched the Unity assets packages for interaction on leap motion and use this to implement interesting features such as pinching to pick up a ball. I also did more research on VRTK which is a assets package for Unity. I practiced using their prewritten script to add features to my Unity game such as simple movements and camera tracking player.
