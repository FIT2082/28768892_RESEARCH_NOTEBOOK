# Week 7
## Meeting
In this meeting, we shared our papers that we have gathered that were categorised by their types such as papers on how to visualise data, or papers on natural interaction methods. 
We also demonstrated what we have so far on Unity which was not much, but it was a strong start on implementation. 
We also discussed the model and its components which may cause some problems such as not having objected isolated and no joined to other objects so that we can actually select an object when we want to work with it later. 

# Before the next meeting
We got the leap hands in our 3D model so that we can use the hands with the model, we also implemented basic interactive methods such has pinching and grabbing objects. 
For this we created a cube and put it inside our environment so that we were able to use the movement functionality we implemented last week to walk to it the use the leap motion hands to pinch the object to pick it up and throw it. 
This is not useful functionality for our Unity project but we used to better familiarise ourselves with the capabilities of the leap motion. 
We also discussed the direction of our project which is constantly being discussed as we realised the ability of some of the new technology we have access to.
